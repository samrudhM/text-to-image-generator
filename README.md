Text-to-Image Generation

1. **Objective**:
   - The goal of this project is to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions (prompts).
2. **Model Selection**:
    we use Stable Diffusion Pipeline as image generation model.
   - We use the **Stable Diffusion v1-4** model, a powerful text-to-image generator.
   - This model combines text encoders and conditional diffusion to create realistic images.
4. **Code Overview**:
   - We set up the model with specific parameters (e.g., `torch_dtype`, `revision`, and `guidance_scale`).
 Overall, this project explores the exciting intersection of language and visual content, creating a bridge between imagination and pixels!
